## What I Used

This project is created using ReactJS with TypeScript and styled with CSS using the BEM methodology.

### ReactJS

I chose React for this project because it is a great JavaScript library and a technology i mastered fairly recently. Fast rendering and code reusability are just some of the things that made React my go to choice for developing websites.

> Even though this is a small assignment and using vanilla JavaScript would be sufficient, i chose React because it is my preferred choice and I wanted to display my abilities.

### TypeScript

I use TypeScript because it is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that offers better code maintainability, scalability, and developer productivity through improved type checking, code completion, and error handling.

### CSS with BEM Methodology

> This project follows the BEM methodology per request of the company I'm applying to.

BEM is a CSS methodology that provides a clear and consistent naming convention for styling HTML elements, making it easier to maintain and scale CSS code-bases. It also helps to avoid style conflicts and improve code readability.
